# Braille Sounds
A simple app to practice using react-native-braille-six-key-input component.

WIP. End goal is to have the react-native-braille-six-key-input act as an instrument, so users can practice hitting the correct braille dots while receiving audio feedback.

## Build Steps
This project currently uses expo for quick prototyping. To build and run the project, you'll need Expo XDE on your dev machine and the expo client app on your phone. The instructions at the expo  [up and running](https://docs.expo.io/versions/v28.0.0/workflow/up-and-running) page should be enough to get going.
